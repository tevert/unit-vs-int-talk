## What are unit tests and integration tests?

???

We need common verbiage, for ourselves, our tools, and the larger internet

---

class: center, middle

## Why do we test, anyway? 

---

class: center, middle

## 'Cause we mess stuff up sometimes

---

class: center, middle

## We want to find out quick

## What kinda stuff do we mess up?

???

2 things

---

class: center, middle

## Sometimes I'm bad at wodrs

---

class: center, middle, overflowing

## Formatting is also sometimes difficult

---

class: center, middle

## And I'm bad at math sometimes

---

class: center, middle

## Different problems should have different solutions

???

Let's talk about why

---

class: center, middle

## Automation is good

---

class: center, middle

## How can we test logic?

???

Easy, that's a unit test.
We can just run code, we don't need databases or servers or networks or anything.

---

## How can we test data?

???
 
Well that might be easy, or it might not
But now you need a database, or a service, or a library, or a system
That's why we call these things integration tests
How hard is it to set that stuff up? How hard is it to set that stuff up automatically?

## How can we test our UI?

???

A buddy of mine one made a special USB-controlled harness to physically rotate a phone, for testing

---

class: center, middle

## When we're testing data, it's an INTEGRATION test

???

We have to set stuff up, but we can still automate them

---

class: center, middle

## When we're testing logic, it's a UNIT test

???

We're testing ONLY logic
They're *fast*, repeatable, small

---

class: center, middle

## #1 Question - what am I testing?

---

class: center, middle

## Nearly all software is logic

???

This is why unit tests are all the rage now

class: center, middle

So next time you're considering how to tackle the testing of something, I'd encourage thinking about the broader question - what am I checking for, and what's the best way to check for that?
