# mocking-talk
A brief talk on mocking, with remarkjs slides and .NET samples

Open index.html for the slides - built using remark.js

The sample projects are designed to fill out the agenda items that don't have slides - 
the first is a common bad starting point to use as a refactoring example. 
The second example is designed to show how mocks work under-the-hood... "how would we do this without a library?"
The third example is designed to showcase NSubstitute, as well as quick looks into Moq and Autofixture
